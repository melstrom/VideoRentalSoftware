todos/decisions
- when will transactionID be set? when payment is made or when transaction is completed?
or should it be set in the constructor? what if a transaction is canceled in the middle after setting the transactionID in constructor
- same with transactionDate, when should it be set, after payment or in constructor?
- when should tax amount be calculated? after item is added or after payment is made or whenever getTax() method is called?
- Maybe the methods checkOutBy*() should be in another class and the method setPaymentMethod() should be a method in this class
- printReciept() not done: what should be displayed? This sounds like a method for the main program because most of the info for a reciept can be gotten from methods in the transaction class (getDate(), getTotal(), etc).
- should transactionID be an int?
*/

/*
todo: update class diagram for transaction to version2
- remove printReciept() method
- add precondition to printReciept(), where ever it goes, it can only print if the transaction has been paid

- add methods so a printReciept method can be done in the main program
- add method isPaid() : boolean
- add method getCustomerFirstName()
- add method getCustomerLastName()
- add method getCustomerID()
- add method getNumberOfItems()
- add method getItemType(int itemNumber)
- add method getItemName(int itemNumber)
- add method getItemPrice(int itemNumber)

- add method markPaid(PaymentMethod payment)


- maybe add another class PaymentMethod with attributes: ammountInCents and type and methods: int getAmountInCents() and String getType()
- maybe add anouther class CreditCardMachine with methods: public boolean verify(int CCnumber, int amountInCents, int pin)
- maybe add another class DebitMachine in similar fashion as CreditCardMachine
- CrediCardMachine and DebitMachine could be subclass of PaymentMachine class with methods: boolean verify(int CCnumber, int amountInCents, int pin)
